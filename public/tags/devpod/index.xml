      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I decided to ditch NixOS, as it was getting in the way of my work. I&amp;rsquo;ve setup a Fedora based distribution called Bluefin, which went smoothly but has taken some getting used to. There are things that have been great, and some not so much, mainly due to the desktop environment, which I&amp;rsquo;ll need to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve setup a dotfiles management solution that is the best I&amp;rsquo;ve had. Credit to Mischa and Rio. It is highly portable across bare-metal and containers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
