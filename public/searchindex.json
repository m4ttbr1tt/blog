[{"content":"Yesterday I set out to work through getting disk encryption configured on one of the 5 OptiPlex 7040 Mini PCS that arrived yesterday. I will be setting up my homelab with these machines and want to make sure I have mastered the process of disk partitioning and encryption.\nThe layout of the partitions and volumes will look like this:\nThe size of the SSD is 128GB so I\u0026rsquo;ll be arranging the partitions/volumes like below:\ncat /proc/meminfo # how much memory on the system # Memtotal 8010000 kB = 8GB # So swap will be 4GB (50%) # sda is 128GB # par boot 1GB # par swap 4GB # par root 24GB # par home 90GB GPT (GUID Partition Table)or MBR partition table GPT (GUID Partition Table) is a newer partition table schema that allows for unlimited partitions and larger drives and is used with UEFI firmware, which is a newer version of BIOS. The older MBR (Master Boot Record) partition table is legacy format.\nCheck the system boot type We need to verify that the system is using UEFI firmware, which replaces BIOS, and is typically used with GPT partitions.\n# if the below dir exists its an uefi system ls /sys/firmware/efi To determine the current disk partition table we run:\nfdisk -l # youll see Disklabel type: gpt or dos(mbr) # if there is no partition table or you can create a new one fdisk /dev/vda m # man page g #to create a new GPT partition table Partitioning the Disks We will setup two disk partitions that will be the EFI and LVM partitions. Arch wiki suggests boot partition size of 1GB, and rest of the disk will be for LVM (Logical Volume Manager). LVM allows for more flexible management of disks space and our partitions will be setup within this layer.\nlsblk # list block devices (shows current disk layout) fdisk /dev/vda n # add a new partition #default partition number (default): 1 #first sector (default) : 2048 #last sector: +1G #Change the type filesystem type: t # change file system type 1 # select partition L # show partition types # Set partition type to EFI 1 # create data partition n # new partition #default partition number (default): 2 #first sector (default) : 20992000 #last sector (default): 4000797392 t # change file system type 2 # select partition L # show partition types # Set partition type to Linux LVM 44 p # print partition table w # write changes to the disk fdisk -l Encryption \u0026amp; LVM Using LVM makes managing encryption of the disk more straightforward as you only required one key / password to unlock the data.\n# Create the encrypted container on the Linux LVM partition cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/vda2 YES #Enter the passphrase x 2 and open the disk to setup volumes cryptsetup open /dev/vda2 cryptlvm # Create a PV(physical volume) on-top of the opened luks container pvcreate /dev/mapper/cryptlvm # Next create a disk volume group (we are naming ours phoenix) vgcreate phoenix /dev/mapper/cryptlvm # Next create our logical volumes in the volume group lvcreate -L 4G phoenix -n swap lvcreate -L 24G phoenix -n root lvcreate -L 90G phoenix -n home # show our volumes lvdisplay File systems Now that we have or disk arranged how we have planned, we need to setup a file system on each logical volume, we will be using ext4.\n# setup the file system mkfs.ext4 /dev/phoenix/root mkfs.ext4 /dev/phoenix/home # and the swap mkswap /dev/phoenix1/swap # Prepare the boot partition by making a FAT32 file system mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/vda1 df -h # outputs file systems you have (-h is human readable format) Mounting the volumes For our system to access the new partitions / volumes we need to mount them first.\nOrder of mount matters we must map root, boot and then home.\n# mnt will be the install systems root / directory mount /dev/phoenix/root /mnt mount --mkdir /dev/vda1 /mnt/boot mount /dev/phoenix/home /home # activate the swap partition swapon /dev/phoenix/swap df -h And we are done, we can now processed with setting up our Arch Linux system.

It serves as a record for you and the world.\nContent doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be complicated or original\nAs you are going to be posting your content publicly, it will improve the quality of your note taking, and thus your learning and understanding of a topic. The purpose of the content is information transfer not entertainment, there is no need for literary genius or originality.\nThere is no need to be a perfectionist\nShare everything you learn on various platforms, long format and short. If posting to a blog, then reuse your content on LinkedIn and X.\nMake sure to reuse your own content on each platform\nContent generation, rooted in writing, will create opportunity Writing is an enabling and empowering activity. It will allow you to generate a lot of content to share on a variety of platforms. This will open new opportunities, many of which you can not foresee.\nEverything starts with writing, so take personal notes for everything you learn or consume. (Eg in Obsidian)\nBuilding a Personal Brand Being active in the digital world is critical, especially if you are trying to grow your career in an industry that requires proof of experience and skills, the analog world is becoming less relevant.\nIn order to build a strong online presence, you need to have a personal brand that shows your value to others. Your personal brand is how you want others to perceive you, and this is facilitated through writing and associated content creation.\nA strong personal brand will open opportunities as it will have reach and a large audience. If executed consistently you will be able to leverage this to your benefit.\nJobs will come to you and unexpected things will happen.\n","date":"13 May, 2025","id":4,"permalink":"/posts/building-a-personal-brand/","summary":"In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to outline the purpose of building an online presence and personal brand.
