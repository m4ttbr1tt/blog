[{"content":"18 months on NixOS… and I’m done. I’m moving to Bluefin. I loved the idea of NixOS, a declarative, reproducible, git tracked OS.\nBut…\nIt distracted me from doing real work When I needed flexibility, it refused (or asked for a time investment to get things done) The OS is not relevant in the DevOps community, even though the package manager has its uses. The final straw was not being able to run DevContainers due to a read-only file system (I could have persisted to sort it out, but I\u0026rsquo;m done now). Its over.\nI\u0026rsquo;m grateful for the time I\u0026rsquo;ve had with the ecosystem, it taught me a lot about what I value in a system. I\u0026rsquo;ve also come to realise the exorbitant amount of time I\u0026rsquo;ve sunk into \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; getting my workstation configured, fancy \u0026ldquo;ricing\u0026rdquo; and tweaks every day! I\u0026rsquo;m done now. I need to focus on doing real work.\nI’m now trying out Bluefin. It offers container-first design, sensible defaults, and still feels close to GitOps principles—without being overly rigid.\nNo regrets. NixOS taught me a lot, but it’s time for a change. (although Im keeping my github repo still)\nIll be writing about Bluefin in a future post.\nSome Bluefin Kubernetes CLI goodness\u0026hellip;\n","date":"21 May, 2025","id":0,"permalink":"/posts/18-months-on-nixos-and-im-done-moving-to-bluefin/","summary":"18 months on NixOS… and I’m done.

It serves as a record for you and the world.\nContent doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be complicated or original\nAs you are going to be posting your content publicly, it will improve the quality of your note taking, and thus your learning and understanding of a topic. The purpose of the content is information transfer not entertainment, there is no need for literary genius or originality.\nThere is no need to be a perfectionist\nShare everything you learn on various platforms, long format and short. If posting to a blog, then reuse your content on LinkedIn and X.\nMake sure to reuse your own content on each platform\nContent generation, rooted in writing, will create opportunity Writing is an enabling and empowering activity. It will allow you to generate a lot of content to share on a variety of platforms. This will open new opportunities, many of which you can not foresee.\nEverything starts with writing, so take personal notes for everything you learn or consume. (Eg in Obsidian)\nBuilding a Personal Brand Being active in the digital world is critical, especially if you are trying to grow your career in an industry that requires proof of experience and skills, the analog world is becoming less relevant.\nIn order to build a strong online presence, you need to have a personal brand that shows your value to others. Your personal brand is how you want others to perceive you, and this is facilitated through writing and associated content creation.\nA strong personal brand will open opportunities as it will have reach and a large audience. If executed consistently you will be able to leverage this to your benefit.\nJobs will come to you and unexpected things will happen.\n","date":"13 May, 2025","id":2,"permalink":"/posts/building-a-personal-brand/","summary":"In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to outline the purpose of building an online presence and personal brand.
