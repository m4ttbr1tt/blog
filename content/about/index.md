Howzit!

My name is Matt Britt, I live in Cape Town, South Africa.

You have found my journal of a personal journey of learning. I've been a software engineer for almost 20 years, and have decided to take on the challenge of getting into DevOps.

In a personal capacity I have been using Linux and VIM for the last 10 years. It is üòç.

I'm always learning.
