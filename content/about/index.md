Howzit, I’m Matt Britt. I live in Cape Town, South Africa 🇿🇦😍. I’ve been working in tech for close to 20 years.

My journey began in networking and support, before I took time out to study and moved into software engineering. Over the years I was naturally drawn into the world of DevOps, where I’ve found a strong sense of alignment with my interests in systems, automation, and continuous learning.

#### Why this blog, and why now?

For most of my career, I’ve chosen to stay relatively private. But the industry is changing, and continues to change, faster than ever. With increasing uncertainty and noise, I’ve realised the importance of having a visible, authentic presence and personal brand.

This blog is where I document what I’m learning, reflect on where I’ve been, and share thoughts on the technologies and practices that matter to me.

> I’ve always been driven by curiosity and a desire to improve.

Welcome and thanks for your interest 🤩
