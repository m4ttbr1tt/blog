Howzit, Iâ€™m Matt Britt.

I live in Cape Town, South Africa, and Iâ€™ve been working in tech for close to 20 years.

My journey began in networking and support, before I took time out to study and moved into software engineering. Over the years, that naturally led me deeper into the world of DevOps, where Iâ€™ve found a strong sense of alignment with my interests in systems, automation, and continuous learning.

#### Why this blog, and why now?

> Iâ€™ve always been driven by curiosity and a desire to improve.

For most of my career, Iâ€™ve chosen to stay relatively private. I focused on doing the work, not talking about it. But the industry is changing, and continues to change, faster than ever. With increasing uncertainty and noise, Iâ€™ve realised the importance of having a visible, authentic presence and personal brand.

This blog is where I document what Iâ€™m learning, reflect on where Iâ€™ve been, and share thoughts on the technologies and practices that matter to me.

Welcome and thanks for your interest ðŸ¤©
