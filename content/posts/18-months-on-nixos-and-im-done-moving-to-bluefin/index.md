18 months on NixOS… and I’m done.  I’m moving to Bluefin. I loved the idea of NixOS,  a declarative, reproducible, git tracked OS.

But…

1.  It distracted me from doing real work
2. When I needed flexibility, it refused (or asked for a time investment to get things done)
3.  The OS is not relevant in the DevOps community, even though the package manager has its uses.

The final straw was not being able to run DevContainers due to a read-only file system  (I could have persisted to sort it out, but I'm done now). Its over.

I'm grateful for the time I've had with the ecosystem, it taught me a lot about what I value in a system.  I've also come to realise the exorbitant amount of time I've sunk into "just" getting my workstation configured, fancy "ricing" and tweaks every day! I'm done now. I need to focus on doing real work.

I’m now trying out Bluefin. It offers container-first design, sensible defaults, and still feels close to GitOps principles—without being overly rigid.

No regrets. NixOS taught me a lot, but it’s time for a change. (although Im keeping my github repo still)

Ill be writing about Bluefin in a future post.

Some Bluefin Kubernetes CLI goodness...
