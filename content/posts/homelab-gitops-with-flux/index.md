### What is GitOps?

GitOps is a best practice for code delivery of applications and infrastructure. It uses git as the source of truth and a controller that runs on the cluster, constantly checking the git repo for any changes and reconciling the declared state with the cluster.

> GitOps enables declarative cluster state

When I first used Kubernetes in production in 2018, we did not have GitOps.

### Which GitOps tool to choose?

There are two main tools in this space Flux and Argo
